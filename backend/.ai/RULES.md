# Non-Negotiable Rules & Invariants

> **NOTICE FOR AI AGENTS**: These rules are binding constraints derived from the Software Requirements Specification ([`backend/docs/srs.md`](../docs/srs.md)), architectural safety requirements, and production reliability standards. Never bypass or disable these checks.

---

## 1. Multi-Tenant Isolation (SRS REQ-4 & Section 5.3)

- **Rule 1.1**: Every project ("World") must be scoped to an authenticated user (`user_id`).
- **Rule 1.2**: Never execute a database query or mutation that accesses world data without verifying ownership against the authenticated `current_user.id`.
- **Rule 1.3**: When running tests or public endpoints, handle optional users explicitly; never leak tenant identifiers across sessions.

---

## 2. Rule-Based Contradiction Verification (SRS REQ-27)

- **Rule 2.1**: **NEVER delegate contradiction detection to a Language Model.**
- **Rule 2.2**: Contradiction detection must be executed via deterministic Python algorithms in [`ConsistencyService`](../app/services/consistency_service.py) or dedicated rule modules.
- **Rule 2.3**: Mandatory contradiction rule categories:
  1. **Age Monotonicity (REQ-23)**: Character age cannot decrease across progressing chapters unless explicitly flagged as a flashback.
  2. **Location Clash (REQ-24)**: A character cannot be in two distinct geographical locations within the same chapter/timeframe.
  3. **Relationship Incompatibility (REQ-25)**: Mutually exclusive relationship mutations (e.g. `ENEMY_OF` vs `MARRIED_TO`, conflicting parentage).
  4. **Post-Mortem Actions (REQ-26)**: A character marked with status `DEAD` or whose death event occurred cannot speak, act, or initiate events in later chapters.
  5. **Temporal Graph Cycles (REQ-27)**: Temporal relations (`BEFORE`/`AFTER`) must form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG); cycles detected via DFS must be flagged as `CYCLE` contradictions.

---

## 3. Permanent State Immutability (SRS REQ-22 & Section 6)

- **Rule 3.1**: **Never execute an in-place SQL `UPDATE` on fact values or relationship types.**
- **Rule 3.2**: When an attribute or relationship is modified, append a new version row (`FactVersion`, `RelationshipVersion`) with the appropriate status:
  - `ACTIVE`: The current confirmed value.
  - `SUPERSEDED`: A valid chronological evolution or change of state.
  - `CONTRADICTED`: A conflicting value that triggered a contradiction record.
- **Rule 3.3**: Never delete historical chapters or versions when re-extracting text.

---

## 4. Performance Latency Budgets (SRS Section 5.1)

- **Rule 4.1**: Single chapter extraction must complete in **≤ 10 seconds**.
- **Rule 4.2**: Contradiction detection must complete in **≤ 5 seconds**.
- **Rule 4.3**: Character chat responses must be returned in **≤ 3 seconds**.

---

## 5. Database Schema & Migration Invariants

- **Rule 5.1**: Every change to SQLAlchemy models in [`app/models/`](../app/models/) **must** include an Alembic migration in [`alembic/versions/`](../alembic/versions/).
- **Rule 5.2**: All foreign keys must define explicit cascading semantics (`ondelete="CASCADE"` or `ondelete="SET NULL"`).
- **Rule 5.3**: Avoid naming column attributes with reserved SQLAlchemy names (e.g. always import `from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship as sa_relationship` if a model class defines a column named `relationship`).

---

## 6. API & Schema Standards

- **Rule 6.1**: All Pydantic models must use Pydantic V2 `model_config = ConfigDict(from_attributes=True)`. Do not use deprecated `class Config: from_attributes = True`.
- **Rule 6.2**: All datetime objects must use timezone-aware standards: `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` instead of `datetime.utcnow()`.
- **Rule 6.3**: HTTP status codes must adhere to REST conventions:
  - Resource created: `201 Created`
  - Asynchronous extraction queued: `202 Accepted`
  - Deletion succeeded: `204 No Content`
  - Missing resource: `404 Not Found`
  - Unauthorized: `401 Unauthorized`

---

## 7. Testing & Verification Gate

- **Rule 7.1**: An agent may **not** declare a task complete if any test in [`app/tests/`](../app/tests/) fails.
- **Rule 7.2**: All new services, endpoints, or rules must be accompanied by unit or integration tests.
- **Rule 7.3**: SQLite in-memory test fixtures must use `StaticPool` and `check_same_thread=False` to prevent thread-isolation `OperationalError` table misses.
