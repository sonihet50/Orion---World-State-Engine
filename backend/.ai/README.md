# Orion World State Engine — AI Agent Entrypoint

Welcome, AI Agent. You are operating inside the **Orion World State Engine (WSE)** backend repository.

> **CRITICAL REPOSITORY CONTEXT**: This repository is a **fork**. All modifications must respect upstream safety, atomic commit hygiene, and strict schema versioning. Never commit haphazard, unverified code or hallucinated assumptions.

## The Mental Model in 30 Seconds

The World State Engine converts narrative fiction prose into a structured, queryable, versioned relational state while algorithmically tracking contradictions.

1. **Extraction is Probabilistic**: An LLM extracts entities, relationships, and events from chapter text into structured JSON.
2. **State Integration is Deterministic**: Mentions are clustered into canonical entities, facts are versioned rather than overwritten, and relationships are mapped.
3. **Consistency Verification is Rule-Based**: Per **SRS REQ-27**, contradiction detection **never** relies on an LLM to decide conflicts. It runs deterministic algorithms (age progression, location clashes, post-mortem actions, relationship mutations, and DFS temporal cycles).
4. **World State is Permanent**: Per **SRS REQ-22 & Section 6**, previously stored facts are never overwritten in SQL. All versions are retained forever.
