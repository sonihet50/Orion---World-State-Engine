# Orion Backend — System Overview

This document describes the runtime components, technical stack decisions, and execution environments of the backend.

---

## 1. Technology Stack & Rationale

| Layer | Technology | Version | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Web Framework** | FastAPI | 0.110+ | High performance, native async/await, OpenAPI generation, typed Pydantic validation. |
| **Validation / Schemas** | Pydantic | 2.6+ | Pydantic V2 Rust core gives 5-10x faster serialization; strict model validation. |
| **ORM / Database Access** | SQLAlchemy | 2.0+ | Modern 2.0-style queries, strong relational mapping, ACID transactions, PostgreSQL support. |
| **Database Engine** | PostgreSQL | 15+ | Reliable relational storage, JSONB columns, foreign key cascade constraints. |
| **Task Queue** | Celery | 5.3+ | Distributed task worker for long-running extraction jobs spanning multi-chapter manuscripts. |
| **Message Broker** | Redis | 7.0+ | In-memory pub/sub and result backend for Celery queues. |
| **Local LLM Engine** | Ollama (Llama 3.1:8b) | — | Zero-cloud cost, privacy-preserving, fast local inference for narrative text extraction. |
| **Testing** | Pytest / AnyIO | 8.0+ | Fast unit and integration tests with in-memory SQLite and mock LLM support. |

## 2. Dual Execution Modes

To ensure the backend is equally enjoyable to develop locally (zero dependencies) as it is in a production cluster, two execution pathways exist:

```
[Manuscript / Chapter Ingestion]
                │
        Is Celery & Redis
           Available?
          /          \
     YES /            \ NO (Local Dev / Offline Tests)
        ▼              ▼
[Celery Task Queue]   [FastAPI BackgroundTasks]
  extract_chapter_task   execute_chapter_extraction()
        │              │
        └───────┬──────┘
                ▼
  [World State Integration]
```

1. **Production / Docker Mode**:
   - Extraction runs are dispatched as Celery tasks (`extract_chapter_task.delay(...)`).
   - Redis manages the queue. Multiple worker instances can run concurrently across machines.
2. **Local Dev / Single Process Mode**:
   - If Redis is unavailable or in development, tasks execute via FastAPI's native `BackgroundTasks`.
   - The same underlying business logic function (`execute_chapter_extraction`) is called, preserving complete functional equivalence.

## 3. Storage Layout

Physical file artifacts (uploaded manuscript text, chapter version snapshots) are managed by [`file_handler.py`](../../app/utils/file_handler.py):

```
backend/storage/
├── worlds/
│   └── <world_id>/
│       └── <uuid>_manuscript.txt     # Original uploaded manuscript file
└── chapters/
    └── <manuscript_id>/
        ├── <uuid>_ch_1_original.txt  # Snapshot of Chapter 1 text
        └── <uuid>_ch_1_rev.txt       # Snapshot of edited Chapter 1 text
```
